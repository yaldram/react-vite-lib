# react-vite-lib-setup

> Base project setup for building a component library with react & vite. I also wrote a tutorial, you can check it [here](https://dev.to/yaldram/react-component-library-setup-with-vite-typescript-styled-components-styled-system-and-storybook-55ad).

### Usage

- Clone the project.
- Run `yarn`.
- Run `yarn storybook`.
- To build the project run `yarn build`.
- You can test the components by publishing the library as a npm package, more on that in the tutorial.
